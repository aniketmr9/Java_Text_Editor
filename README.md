# Java Text Editor
A very basic text editor made in Java using Swing and AWT
# Functionality:
1.Open new editor  
2.Open existing file  
3.Save for already existing file. If file is new Save will open Save As window.    
4.Save As for new file.  
5.Cut, Copy, Paste, SelectAll  
6.Format -> font family, font style and font size  
7.Exit.  

Note:  
1.The formating of the file is inconsistent and I am currently working on making it consistent.  
2.You cannot open the text file directly by right clicking and selecting open with the Jar file, the application first needs to be launched and open option needs to be selected under file menu.
